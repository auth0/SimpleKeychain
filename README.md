> **Note**
> Check the [Support Policy](#support-policy) to learn when dropping Xcode, Swift, and platform versions will not be considered a **breaking change**.

### Installation

#### Swift Package Manager

Open the following menu item in Xcode:

**File > Add Packages...**

In the **Search or Enter Package URL** search box enter this URL: 

```text
https://github.com/auth0/SimpleKeychain
```

Then, select the dependency rule and press **Add Package**.

#### Cocoapods

```

Then, run `carthage bootstrap --use-xcframeworks`.

### Usage

**Learn about more advanced features in [Examples â†—](EXAMPLES.md)**

**See all the available features in the [API documentation â†—](https://auth0.github.io/SimpleKeychain/documentation/simplekeychain)**

```swift
let simpleKeychain = SimpleKeychain()
```

You can specify a service name under which to save items. By default the bundle identifier of your app is used.

```swift
let simpleKeychain = SimpleKeychain(service: "Auth0")
```

#### Store a string or data item

```swift
try simpleKeychain.set(accessToken, forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

#### Check if an item is stored

```swift
let isStored = try simpleKeychain.hasItem(forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

#### Retrieve a string item

```swift
let accessToken = try simpleKeychain.string(forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

#### Retrieve a data item

```swift
let accessToken = try simpleKeychain.data(forKey: "auth0-credentials")
```

#### Retrieve the keys of all stored items

```swift
let keys = try simpleKeychain.keys()
```

#### Remove an item

```swift
try simpleKeychain.deleteItem(forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

#### Remove all items

```swift
try simpleKeychain.deleteAll()
```

#### Error handling

All methods will throw a `SimpleKeychainError` upon failure.

```swift
catch let error as SimpleKeychainError {
    print(error)
}
```

## Support Policy

This Policy defines the extent of the support for Xcode, Swift, and platform (iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS) versions in SimpleKeychain.

### Xcode

The only supported versions of Xcode are those that can be currently used to submit apps to the App Store. Once a Xcode version becomes unsupported, dropping it from SimpleKeychain **will not be considered a breaking change**, and will be done in a **minor** release.

### Swift

The minimum supported Swift minor version is the one released with the oldest-supported Xcode version. Once a Swift minor becomes unsupported, dropping it from SimpleKeychain **will not be considered a breaking change**, and will be done in a **minor** release.

### Platforms

Only the last 4 major platform versions are supported, starting from:

- iOS **12**
- macOS **10.15**
- macCatalyst **13**
- tvOS **12**
- watchOS **6.2**

Once a platform version becomes unsupported, dropping it from SimpleKeychain **will not be considered a breaking change**, and will be done in a **minor** release. For example, iOS 13 will cease to be supported when iOS 17 gets released, and SimpleKeychain will be able to drop it in a minor release.

In the case of macOS, the yearly named releases are considered a major platform version for the purposes of this Policy, regardless of the actual version numbers.
