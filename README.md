## Usage

```swift
let keychain = A0SimpleKeychain()
```

### Save an entry

```swift
keychain.setString(accessToken, forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

### Retrieve an entry

```swift
let accessToken = keychain.string(forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

### Remove an entry

```swift
keychain.deleteEntry(forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

### Remove all entries

This is useful for testing.

```swift
keychain.clearAll()
```

### Require Touch ID / Face ID to retrieve an entry

First, configure the SimpleKeychain instance to use Face ID / Touch ID.

```swift
keychain.useAccessControl = true
keychain.defaultAccessiblity = .whenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly
keychain.setTouchIDAuthenticationAllowableReuseDuration(5.0)
```

When retrieving an entry, specify a prompt message for Face ID / Touch ID.

```swift
let message = NSLocalizedString("Please enter your passcode or fingerprint to login with Awesome App!", comment: "Prompt message")
let accessToken = keychain.string(forKey: "auth0-access-token", promptMessage: message)
```

### Share entries with other apps and extensions using an Access Group

When creating the SimpleKeychain instance, specify the Access Group that the app may share entries with.

```swift
let keychain = A0SimpleKeychain(service: "Auth0", accessGroup: "ABCDEFGH.com.example.myaccessgroup")
keychain.setString(accessToken, forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

## Issue Reporting

For general support or usage questions, use the [Auth0 Community](https://community.auth0.com/c/sdks/5) forums or raise a [support ticket](https://support.auth0.com/). Only [raise an issue](https://github.com/auth0/SimpleKeychain/issues) if you have found a bug or want to request a feature.

**Do not report security vulnerabilities on the public GitHub issue tracker.** The [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://auth0.com/responsible-disclosure-policy) details the procedure for disclosing security issues.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions).

**Why Auth0?** Because you should save time, be happy, and focus on what really matters: building your product.
