- iOS 12.0+ / macOS 10.15+ / tvOS 12.0+ / watchOS 6.2+
- Xcode 13.x / 14.x
- Swift 5.x

> ⚠️ Check the [Support Policy](#support-policy) to learn when dropping Xcode, Swift, and platform versions will not be considered a **breaking change**.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Open the following menu item in Xcode:

**File > Add Packages...**

In the **Search or Enter Package URL** search box enter this URL: 

```text
https://github.com/auth0/SimpleKeychain
```

Then, select the dependency rule and press **Add Package**.

> 💡 For further reference on SPM, check its [official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).

### Cocoapods

Add the following line to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SimpleKeychain', '~> 1.0'
```

Then, run `pod install`.

> 💡 For further reference on Cocoapods, check their [official documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

### Carthage

Add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

```text
github "auth0/SimpleKeychain" ~> 1.0
```

Then, run `carthage bootstrap --use-xcframeworks`.

> 💡 For further reference on Carthage, check their [official documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started).

## Usage

```swift
let keychain = A0SimpleKeychain()
```

### Save an entry

```swift
keychain.setString(accessToken, forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

### Retrieve an entry

```swift
let accessToken = keychain.string(forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

### Remove an entry

```swift
keychain.deleteEntry(forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

### Remove all entries

This is useful for testing.

```swift
keychain.clearAll()
```

### Require Touch ID / Face ID to retrieve an entry

First, configure the SimpleKeychain instance to use Face ID / Touch ID.

```swift
keychain.useAccessControl = true
keychain.defaultAccessiblity = .whenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly
keychain.setTouchIDAuthenticationAllowableReuseDuration(5.0)
```

When retrieving an entry, specify a prompt message for Face ID / Touch ID.

```swift
let message = NSLocalizedString("Please enter your passcode or fingerprint to login with Awesome App!", comment: "Prompt message")
let accessToken = keychain.string(forKey: "auth0-access-token", promptMessage: message)
```

### Share entries with other apps and extensions using an Access Group

When creating the SimpleKeychain instance, specify the Access Group that the app may share entries with.

```swift
let keychain = A0SimpleKeychain(service: "Auth0", accessGroup: "ABCDEFGH.com.example.myaccessgroup")
keychain.setString(accessToken, forKey: "auth0-access-token")
```

## Support Policy

This Policy defines the extent of the support for Xcode, Swift, and platform (iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS) versions in SimpleKeychain.

### Xcode

The only supported versions of Xcode are those that can be currently used to submit apps to the App Store. Once a Xcode version becomes unsupported, dropping it from SimpleKeychain **will not be considered a breaking change**, and will be done in a **minor** release.

### Swift

The minimum supported Swift minor version is the one released with the oldest-supported Xcode version. Once a Swift minor becomes unsupported, dropping it from SimpleKeychain **will not be considered a breaking change**, and will be done in a **minor** release.

### Platforms

Only the last 4 major platform versions are supported, starting from:

- iOS **12**
- macOS **10.15**
- Catalyst **13**
- tvOS **12**
- watchOS **6.2**

Once a platform version becomes unsupported, dropping it from SimpleKeychain **will not be considered a breaking change**, and will be done in a **minor** release. For example, iOS 12 will cease to be supported when iOS 16 gets released, and SimpleKeychain will be able to drop it in a minor release.

In the case of macOS, the yearly named releases are considered a major platform version for the purposes of this Policy, regardless of the actual version numbers.

## Issue Reporting

For general support or usage questions, use the [Auth0 Community](https://community.auth0.com/c/sdks/5) forums or raise a [support ticket](https://support.auth0.com/). Only [raise an issue](https://github.com/auth0/SimpleKeychain/issues) if you have found a bug or want to request a feature.

**Do not report security vulnerabilities on the public GitHub issue tracker.** The [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://auth0.com/responsible-disclosure-policy) details the procedure for disclosing security issues.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple sources](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers), either social identity providers such as **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce** (amongst others), or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS, or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/database-connections/custom-db)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/user-accounts/user-account-linking)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/json-web-tokens) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile through [JavaScript Actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions).

**Why Auth0?** Because you should save time, be happy, and focus on what really matters: building your product.
