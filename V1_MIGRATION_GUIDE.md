# v1 Migration Guide

SimpleKeychain v1 includes a few significant changes:

- Improved error handling.
- Support for custom attributes.
- Support for sharing items with other devices through iCloud synchronization.

As expected with a major release, SimpleKeychain v1 contains breaking changes. Please review this guide thorougly to understand the changes required to migrate your application to v1.

## Supported Languages

### Swift

The minimum supported Swift version is now **5.5**.

### Objective-C

SimpleKeychain no longer supports Objective-C.

## Supported Platform Versions

The deployment targets for each platform were raised to:

- iOS **12.0**
- macOS **10.15**
- tvOS **12.0**
- watchOS **6.2**

## Types Removed

- The `A0SimpleKeychainError` enum was removed in favor of the new `SimpleKeychainError` enum.
- The `A0SimpleKeychainItemAccessible` enum was removed in favor of the new `Accessibility` enum.
- The `A0ErrorDomain` macro was removed.
- The `A0LocalAuthenticationCapable` macro was removed.

## Properties removed

### SimpleKeychain Struct

#### `defaultAccessiblity`

The property `defaultAccessiblity` was removed in favor of the new `accessibility` initalizer parameter.

<details>
  <summary>Before / After</summary>

```swift
// Before
let simpleKeychain = A0SimpleKeychain()
simpleKeychain.defaultAccessiblity = .whenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly

// After
let simpleKeychain = SimpleKeychain(accessibility: .whenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly)
```
</details>

#### `useAccessControl`

The property `useAccessControl` was removed in favor of the new `accessControlFlags` initializer parameter.

<details>
  <summary>Before / After</summary>

```swift
// Before
let simpleKeychain = A0SimpleKeychain()
simpleKeychain.useAccessControl = true

// After
let simpleKeychain = SimpleKeychain(accessControlFlags: .userPresence)
```
</details>

#### `localAuthenticationContext`

The property `localAuthenticationContext` was removed in favor of the new `context` initializer parameter. This means that SimpleKeychain will no longer create an `LAContext` instance, and instead one must be provided through the initializer.

<details>
  <summary>Before / After</summary>

```swift
// Before
let simpleKeychain = A0SimpleKeychain()
let context = simpleKeychain.localAuthenticationContext

// After
let context = LAContext()
let simpleKeychain = SimpleKeychain(context: context)
```
</details>

#### No longer public

The following properties are no longer public:

- `service`
- `accessGroup`

## Methods Removed

### SimpleKeychain Struct

#### `setTouchIDAuthenticationAllowableReuseDuration(_:)`

The `setTouchIDAuthenticationAllowableReuseDuration(_:)` method was removed. Configure that through an `LAContext` instance instead.

<details>
  <summary>Before / After</summary>

```swift
// Before
let simpleKeychain = A0SimpleKeychain()
simpleKeychain.setTouchIDAuthenticationAllowableReuseDuration(10)

// After
let context = LAContext()
context.touchIDAuthenticationAllowableReuseDuration = 10
let simpleKeychain = SimpleKeychain(context: context)
```
</details>

#### No replacement

The following methods were removed and have no replacement:

- `publicRSAKeyData(forTag:)`
- `generateRSAKeyPair(withLength:publicKeyTag:privateKeyTag:)`
- `dataForRSAKey(withTag:)`
- `keyRefOfRSAKey(withTag:)`
- `deleteRSAKey(withTag:)`
- `hasRSAKey(withTag:)`

## Types Changed

`A0SimpleKeychain` was renamed to `SimpleKeychain`, and was changed from class to struct.

## Method Signatures Changed

### SimpleKeychain Struct

All the methods now **throw** a `SimpleKeychainError` upon failure.

#### Methods renamed

| Old                    | New                   |
|:-----------------------|:----------------------|
| `setString(forKey:)`   | `set(_:forKey:)`      |
| `setData(forKey:)`     | `set(_:forKey:)`      |
| `hasValue(forKey:)`    | `hasItem(forKey:)`    |
| `deleteEntry(forKey:)` | `deleteItem(forKey:)` |
| `clearAll()`           | `deleteAll()`         |

#### Parameters removed

#### `promptMessage`

The `promptMessage` parameter was removed from the following methods, as `kSecUseOperationPrompt` [is deprecated](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecuseoperationprompt):

- `string(forKey:)`
- `data(forKey:)`
- `set(_:forKey:)`

Configure the message through an `LAContext` instance instead, using the `LAContext.localizedReason` property.

#### `error`

The `error` parameter was removed from the `data(forKey:)` method, as it now throws a `SimpleKeychainError`. 

## Behavior Changes

### SimpleKeychain Struct

- `kSecUseAuthenticationUI` is no longer used. Configure whether the user should be prompted for authentication through an `LAContext` instance instead, using the `LAContext.interactionNotAllowed` property.
- The `hasItem(forKey:)` method no longer retuns `false` whenever any error occurs. Now it only returns `false` when the error is `errSecItemNotFound`.
